# Pre-work - *Gude-Tab-a*

**Gude-Tab-a** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Nashir Janmohamed**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Button to hide keyboard if user doesn't want keyboard to always show
- [x] Settings screen with specifier for default tip percentage (saved to UserDefaults)
- [x] Custom color theme for dark and light mode
- [x] Helper class with ability so specify colors by hex (not used)
- [x] Splash screen with app logo (which is also displayed in the app thumbnail, iconset created using Icon Set Creator)

## Notes

This project is my first experience with iOS, and the development process was much more intuitive than I would have imagined! I really enjoyed the prework and hope to be able to work on more coursework like this as a student of the Codepath class.
