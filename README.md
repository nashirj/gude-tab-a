# *Gude-Tab-a*

**Gude-Tab-a** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

## User Stories

The following functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
- [x] Button to hide keyboard if user doesn't want keyboard to always show
- [x] Settings screen with specifier for default tip percentage (saved to UserDefaults)
- [x] Custom color theme for dark and light mode
- [x] Helper class with ability to specify colors by hex (not yet used)
- [x] Splash screen with app logo (which is also displayed in the app thumbnail, iconset created using Icon Set Creator)

The following functionality is not yet implemented

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Bill splitting
* [ ] Bill history
